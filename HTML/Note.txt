The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

Here are the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera):

Abbreviation	File Format	File Extension
APNG	Animated Portable Network Graphics	.apng
GIF	Graphics Interchange Format	.gif
ICO	Microsoft Icon	.ico, .cur
JPEG	Joint Photographic Expert Group image	.jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp
PNG	Portable Network Graphics	.png
SVG	Scalable Vector Graphics	.svg
